A basic, static HTML site with a (kinda) landing page/intro/TOC homepage, plus 5 static pages in the PICKYOURSTORY directory and story title subdirectories with their own index.html files for each of 5 demo short stories.

This version of TalesofMurder.com is built to have a basic demo site available for the Author Marketing Live! event in Cleveland, Ohio on September 8, 2014.

It is (probably ... because it seems easier/quicker) hosted on GitHub pages with (hopefully, if I can figure it out!) a custom domain so www.TalesofMurder.com points to this GitHub page/site.
